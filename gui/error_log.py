"""
Record errors and crashes to a log file.

Why this file exists:
    The Windows and macOS builds have no console, so an error that would
    print a message on Linux leaves no trace there, and a hard crash just
    closes the window. This writes every unexpected error, and the Python
    call stack of any hard crash, to a log file the user can send in.

    Unexpected errors in the app's own code also get a pop-up saying where
    the log is; the app keeps running.
