"""
Wrapper around ExifTool for reading and writing GPS metadata.

Why this file exists:
    We do not want GUI code directly calling subprocess commands all over the
    project. This wrapper gives us one clean place to:
    1. check whether ExifTool exists
    2. read and write GPS metadata
    3. read the preview images embedded in RAW files, for thumbnails

Why ExifTool:
    ExifTool is the most reliable way to work with metadata across JPG and many
    RAW formats like CR2, CR3, and DNG.

Why one long-running ExifTool process:
    Starting ExifTool (a Perl program) takes far longer than the GPS read or
    write itself. ExifTool's "-stay_open" mode keeps one process running and
    accepts one command after another through stdin, so batches of photos
    no longer pay the startup cost for every file.
