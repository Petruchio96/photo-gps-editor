# Packaging Notes

The first release packaging target is a PyInstaller one-folder build. This is
easier to debug than a single-file executable and is the safest starting point
for a PySide6 desktop app.

## Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds all three platforms on GitHub's servers:

- Every push to any branch runs the tests on Linux, Windows, and macOS and
  builds each app. Open the run on the repository's Actions tab and download
  the builds from its Artifacts section.
- Pushing a `v*` tag also attaches the builds to that tag's GitHub release,
  creating a draft release if one does not exist.

PyInstaller cannot cross-compile, so this is the easiest way to get Windows and
macOS builds without owning those machines. The manual steps below are still
useful for local testing.

## Linux

Build from the repository root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install PyInstaller
.venv/bin/python packaging/fetch_exiftool.py linux
.venv/bin/python -m PyInstaller photo_gps_editor.spec --noconfirm
tar -C dist -czf dist/photo-gps-editor-linux-x86_64.tar.gz 'Photo GPS Editor'
```

The Linux output is:

```text
dist/Photo GPS Editor/
  Photo GPS Editor
  _internal/
dist/photo-gps-editor-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

The PyInstaller spec bundles:

- `assets/`
- `tools/linux/exiftool` and `tools/linux/lib/`: the same pinned ExifTool
  version as Windows and macOS (ExifTool's Perl distribution, the same archive
  macOS uses), downloaded and checksum-verified by `fetch_exiftool.py linux`

This gives the app its own ExifTool copy while still relying on the system Perl
runtime, which is present by default on many Linux desktop installs. In source
mode the app also prefers `tools/linux/exiftool` when it exists, and falls back
to the `exiftool` on PATH.

## Windows

Build on Windows rather than cross-compiling from Linux.

1. Install Python 3.12.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install runtime dependencies and PyInstaller.
4. Download ExifTool into `tools/windows/` (checksum-verified):
   `python packaging/fetch_exiftool.py windows`. See `tools/windows/README.md`
   to do this by hand instead.
5. Run:

```powershell
python -m PyInstaller photo_gps_editor.spec --noconfirm
```

The Windows output will be a one-folder app containing `Photo GPS Editor.exe`.
Zip that folder for the first Windows release.

## macOS

Build on a Mac (Apple Silicon builds run on Apple Silicon Macs only).

1. Install Python 3.12 and create a virtual environment.
2. Install runtime dependencies and PyInstaller.
3. Download ExifTool into `tools/macos/`: `python packaging/fetch_exiftool.py macos`.
   The app runs it with the Perl that ships with macOS.
4. Run:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller photo_gps_editor.spec --noconfirm
ditto -c -k --keepParent "dist/Photo GPS Editor.app" dist/photo-gps-editor-macos-arm64.zip
```

The app is not signed or notarized, so macOS blocks it the first time it is
opened. Users can allow it under System Settings > Privacy & Security
("Open Anyway").

## AppImage

An AppImage is the closest Linux equivalent to a downloadable Windows app. Build
it after the PyInstaller folder build launches and passes a manual smoke test:

```bash
packaging/build_appimage.sh
```

If `appimagetool` is not installed, download it and pass it explicitly:

```bash
APPIMAGETOOL=/tmp/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage packaging/build_appimage.sh
```

The AppImage output is:

```text
dist/Photo_GPS_Editor-x86_64.AppImage
```

If a Linux system reports a FUSE error when running the AppImage, install or
enable FUSE for normal AppImage launching. For testing, this fallback avoids
FUSE by extracting first:

```bash
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 dist/Photo_GPS_Editor-x86_64.AppImage
```
